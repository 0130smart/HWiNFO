# HWiNFO Language File

### This repo contains the language file for [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/) v7.17 and later.

### This file is encoded in UTF-8 format and should be opened/modified only in programs supporting this encoding !

Modify only the respective language phrase. Do not modify the "en" value as this needs to match the original phrase in HWiNFO.

{{..}} is a special tag used as a hint telling HWiNFO how/where to translate the item. Do not modify the tag name.

";" is used for comments

"\n" is used as New Line

{{LangName}} lists languages currently supported, adding a new language might require an update in HWiNFO, contact the author.

The language file is embedded in HWiNFO and currently cannot be used separately (this feature is planned).
